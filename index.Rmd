# Preface {-}

**This book is still being developed. If you have any comments to improve this book, let us know.**

The goal of `Superpower` is to easily simulate factorial designs and empirically calculate power using a simulation approach. 
The R package is intended to be utilized for prospective (a priori) power analysis. Calculating [post hoc power](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2014/12/observed-power-and-what-to-do-if-your.html) is not a useful thing to do for single studies. 

This package, and book, expect readers to have some familiarity with R [-@R-base]. However, we have created two Shiny apps (for the [`ANOVA_power`](https://arcaldwell49.github.io/project/shinypowerapp/) & [`ANOVA_exact`](https://arcaldwell49.github.io/project/shinyexactapp/) functions respectively) to help use `Superpower` if you are not familiar with R. Reading through the examples in this book, and reproducing them in the Shiny apps, is probably the easiest way to get started with power analyses in Superpower.

In this book we will display a variety of ways the `Superpower` package can be used for power analysis and sample size planning for factorial experimental designs. We also included various examples of the performance of `Superpower` against other R packages (e.g., `pwr2ppl` by @R-pwr2ppl  and `pwr` by @R-pwr) and statistical programs (such as G*Power @faul2007g, MOREpower  @Campbell2012MorePower6F, and SAS's `PROC GLMPOWER` -@SASglmpower). All uses of the `ANOVA_power` function have been run with 10000 iterations (`nsims = 10000`). If you have any issues using `Superpower` or want to expand its capabilities please raise the issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/arcaldwell49/Superpower/issues) repository.
